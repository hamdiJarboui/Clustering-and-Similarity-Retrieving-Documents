# Clustering-and-Similarity-Retrieving-Documents
nformation retrieval systems provide access to collections of thousands, or millions, of
documents, from which, by providing an appropriate description, users can recover any one.
Typically, users iteratively refine the descriptions they provide to satisfy their needs, and
retrieval systems can utilize user feedback on selected documents to indicate the accuracy of
the description at any stage. The style of description required from the user, and the way it is
employed to search the document database, are consequences of the indexing method used
for the collection. The index may take different forms, from storing keywords with links to
individual documents, to clustering documents under related topics
in this project we gonna work with a dataset that contains

in this project, we apply the algorithm of nearest_neighbors to a dataset which contains the URL, text of the article and the name of the character of the article to determine the similar articles of a selected article
